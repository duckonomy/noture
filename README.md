# Noture: Note-taking for the cli junky
## Problem
I've been an Emacs/Vim user for over 10 years.
And I've always wanted to be able to take all my notes in these text editors.
The main problem was syncing the notes.
I'd always have to either sync them through dropbox/icloud or whatever. Then there's the notorious (link to icloud issues with text sync)
An ideal workflow would be that I have a post save hook (emacs-speak) that syncs my stuff on demand and a tool on my phone that consumes this.
So here it is; noture, the note-taking ecosystem of the retro-future.

Basically scratching my own itch.

Get the app on the apple app store or the android store.
